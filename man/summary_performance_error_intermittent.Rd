\arguments{
\item{dataset}{The dataset. A list including some time series.
In each time series, \code{x} is the historical value, \code{xx} is the true value,
\code{ff} is the forecasting values based on the 12 methods,
and \code{y_hat} is the combined forecast of the proposed method.}

\item{error}{A vector including the errors to output.}
}
\value{
